# Quick-Study
It is NLP model for Question and Answer based on text
### Introduction
QuickStudy is an educational tool designed to help people grasp concepts quickly while avoiding getting stuck. Users can upload pdfs, images or give the text and receive summarised text, allowing them to understand the concept by reading a few sentences rather than a pool of sentences from the original text. Users can also get short and long answers to their text-related questions by simply typing them in. QuickStudy can also generate MCQs and questions along with corresponding short and long answers to assist users in assessing their knowledge of the topic. 

### Features:
QuickStudy contains multiple features which are listed below
#### Summarisation
Text summarization is the process of creating a short, coherent, and fluent summary of a longer text document and involves the outlining of the textâ€™s major points. Extracted text from pdf, image or the text given by the user is taken as input for the model and the summarised text is the expected output of the model.

#### Short answer
Given a question by the user, the model in this module must be able to generate corresponding short answer from the text.

#### Long answer
Given a question by the user, the model in this module must be able to generate corrsponding long answer from the text.
